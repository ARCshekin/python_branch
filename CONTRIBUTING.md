##  Git Workflow

We follow a **feature-branch and pull request** based workflow.

###  Steps

1. **Fork & Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```
2. **Pull Requests**
   Base branch: `main`
   Keep PRs small, focused, and self-contained
